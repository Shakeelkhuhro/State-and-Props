# State: 
State is an object that represents the parts of the component that can change over time. State is private to a component and can only be updated by the component itself. When state changes, React will re-render the component.

## Props: 
Props are short for properties and are used to pass data from one component to another. Props are read-only and should not be modified by the component that receives them. The parent component passes props down to the child component and the child component receives them as an argument in its function.
